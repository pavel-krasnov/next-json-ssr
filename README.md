The repo is an illustration for my article ["A way to speed up Next.js dynamic SSR"](https://dev.to/pavelkrasnov/a-way-to-speed-up-nextjs-dynamic-ssr-27ga).

To run the tests:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm run build` to build a production version of the app;
3. Run `npm start` to run a local Node.js server that will serve your app;
4. Open http://localhost:3000/slow in a browser to make sure Next.js creates a filesystem data cache and the first testing request doesn't send any actual network requests;
5. Install [oha](https://github.com/hatoo/oha) - a tool we will use to send requests to the server;
6. Run `oha http://localhost:3000/slow`. It will send 200 requests through 50 parallel connections to the server.
7. Stop the server and remove the `.next` folder to make sure there is no cached data;
8. Repeat steps 2â€“6, but this time use `http://localhost:3000/fast`.
